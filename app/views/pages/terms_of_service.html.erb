<h1><a></a>People's Housing Terms of Service</h1>
<p>The following are the terms of use (TOU) you agree to abide by accessing Swing Left&#39;s site, servers, or any Swing Left content (together &quot;Swing Left&quot;). Last updated February 21, 2018.</p>

<p>LICENSE. If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable license to access Swing Left in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed access is unauthorized. You agree not to license, distribute, make derivative works, display, sell, or &quot;frame&quot; content from Swing Left, without prior permission from Swing Left. You grant Swing Left a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid, sublicensable license to use, copy, perform, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.</p>

<p>USE. You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed by us) or services that interact or interoperate with Swing Left, e.g. for downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, or spam postings/email. You agree not to collect users&#39; personal and/or contact information (&quot;PI&quot;).</p>

<p>MODERATION. You agree we may moderate Swing Left access and use in our sole discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion, delay, omission, verification, or access/account/license termination. You agree (1) not to bypass this moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS; NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.</p>

<p>To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to Swing Left, its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (2) your access and use are at your own risk, and Swing Left is provided &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot;; (3) we are not liable for any harm resulting from (a) user content; (b) user conduct, e.g. illegal conduct; (c) your Swing Left use; or (d) our representations; (4) WE AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES (&quot;SWING LEFT ENTITIES&quot;), DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES &amp; CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; (5) SWING LEFT ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.</p>

<p>CLAIMS. You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute (&quot;Claim&quot;) arising out of or related to the TOU or your Swing Left use is governed by California (&quot;CA&quot;) law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in San Francisco, CA (except we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year after it arose or be forever barred; (5) (except government agencies) to indemnify Swing Left for any damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims related to your Swing Left use; (6) you are liable for TOU breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (7) to pay us for breaching or inducing others to breach the &quot;USE&quot; section, not as a penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $10 per post, email, flag, or account created, $100 per item of PI collected, and $1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.</p>

<p>MISC. Users complying with prior written licenses may access Swing Left thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a TOU term is unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If TOU translations conflict with the English version, English controls. See Privacy Policy for how we collect, use and share data.
